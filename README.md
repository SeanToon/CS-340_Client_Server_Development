# CS-340_Client_Server_Development

To create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is crucial to apply software development principles and practices. Some of the key principles and practices I used in my project include:

Modularization
Reusable Functions
Documentation
Error Handling
For this project, I used Jupyter Notebook to create the CRUD Python Module, which manipulates the "animal" collection in the "Austin Animal Center" (AAC) database. Using Jupyter or other IDEs, along with PyMongo to access and manipulate data, is a much more practical approach compared to writing commands directly in the MongoDB shell. By creating the module, I not only simplified handling large datasets but also laid the foundation for a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard can be used by both future users and developers to access and manipulate data more efficiently.

As a computer scientist, my development process starts with gathering all available project information and requirements. I focus on planning ahead and collecting as much relevant information as possible to minimize the need for searching for missing details during the development phase. While encountering challenges is inevitable, having a solid understanding of the project beforehand helps me maintain a state of flow throughout the development process.

This project marked my first time using MongoDB and Python, so I faced several challenges along the way. Each time I encountered an issue or moved to the next stage of development, I began with some self-affirmation and then used the resources provided in the course, along with additional online materials, to guide me through the process. Moving forward, for future projects involving databases, I plan to apply the techniques and strategies from this project. Additionally, I hope to explore more advanced methods for filtering and cleaning large datasets, making it easier to understand and manipulate them.

Computer scientists engage in many tasks, and almost everything they create involves working with some form of database. The data used and the dashboard created in this project simulate real-world data and provide a real-world dashboard. This kind of project can be applied to any type of database and any user who needs to access data efficiently. The dashboard allows users to search for specific information in a large database easily and communicate data effectively, quickly, and securely at any time.

The flexibility of this project makes it adaptable to a wide range of industries. The only changes needed would involve updating the data and modifying the methods for data manipulation to suit the specific needs of different businesses or organizations. The ability to search, filter, and manage large datasets is valuable in various contexts, making this approach versatile and scalable for many different applications.
